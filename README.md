# Market-Basket-Analysis

In this project, I use the Aprori algorithm to produce the top 50 high confidence association rules of the given grocery store datasets. The "subset_orders.csv" file is a smaller version of the original "orders.csv" since the original csv file was too big to upload to this repository (3 Million rows).
